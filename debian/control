Description: Polaric Server: APRS daemon part. 
 The "Polaric Server" is mainly a web based service to present tracking 
 information (mainly APRS) on maps and where the information is updated at real-
 time. It is originally targeted for use by radio amateurs in voluntary search
 and rescue service in Norway. It consists of a web application and a server 
 program (APRS daemon). It can function as an offline service if required. 
 .
 The APRS daemon gets data from a TNC or APRS-IS or a combination. It can 
 present and manipulate the information through a simple HTTP service
 (REST API and Websockets). The daemon can also be set up as an igate 
 (internet gateway) or APRS-IS server and can be installed independently 
 of the web app.
