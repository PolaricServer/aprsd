Description: Polaric Server: APRS daemon part. 
 The "Polaric Server" which is mainly a web based service to present APRS 
 tracking information on maps and where the information is updated at real-
 time. It is originally targeted for use by radio amateurs in voluntary search
 and rescue service in Norway. It consists of a web application and a server 
 program (APRS daemon). 
 .
 The APRS daemon gets data from a TNC or APRS-IS or a combination. It can 
 present and manipulate the information through a simple HTTP service. 
 The daemon can also be set up as an igate (internet gateway) and can
 be installed independently of the web app.
