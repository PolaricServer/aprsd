# Script config
#
# Edit this file to configure the use of scripts from REST API.
# Scripts should be placed in the 'scripts' directory and be runnable. Scripts are run as the 'polaric' user, 
# and appropriate measures should be taken to give scripts the proper permissions. Scripts are expected to 
# return a standard code where negative values is used to report an error. 
#
# The return code is returned back to the client. If field 4 (return-stdout) is set to true, the text written 
# by the script to stdout is returned to the client (after the code and a newline). If false, any text that 
# scripts are writing to stdout or stderr are simply redirected to /var/log/polaric/scripts.log. 
#
# Scripts that are not returning within 10 seconds are killed.
# 
# To invoke a script use POST to <server-url>/scripts/<name>. 
# Arguments are sent as JSON object: {"args" : list-of-strings}
#
# Format of config line: One line pr. script: 
#
# name  script  number-of-args  return-stdout  Description
#
