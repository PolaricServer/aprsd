# Polaric APRSD

The "Polaric Server" is mainly a web based service to present APRS tracking information on maps and where 
the information is updated in real-time. It is originally targeted for use by radio amateurs in voluntary 
search and rescue service in Norway. It consists of a web application and a server program (APRS daemon). 
 
The APRS daemon gets data from a TNC or APRS-IS or a combination. It can present 
and manipulate the information through a simple HTTP service (REST API). The daemon can 
also be set up as an igate (internet gateway) and can be installed and run independently 
of the web app. It has its own webserver. 

It is recommended to combine it with polaric-webapp2. It supports CORS to allow it to be used 
with a polaric-webapp2 on another location.

http://aprs.no runs a recent version of this software. More documentation on the project can be found here: 
http://aprs.no/polaricserver or https://polaricserver.readthedocs.io

## Installation

We provide deb (Debian/Ubuntu..) packages. For information on getting started on a Debian based platform please 
see: https://polaricserver.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gettingstarted.html

Documentation on the project can be found here: 
http://aprs.no/polaricserver

To configure a server, use the webapp2. Some command-line scripts are also available: 
polaric-setcall, polaric-password, etc.   

For first-time login use account: username=admin, password=polaric. Remember to change the password at your fist
convenience. 

## Building from source 

You can always compile the sources to a jar file using the 'build.sh' script, on a Linux system a deb package can be generated by using:
   *'debuild -uc -us -b'* 
   
You will need JDK (OpenJDK) version 17 or later. Maven is used for the build process.  
From version 4.0 we use *Javalin* for the webserver-part and a webserver-framework is factored out in a separate software-component: [arctic-core](https://github.com/PolaricServer/Arctic-Core). This is built separately but is just a *'mvn install'*.
