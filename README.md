# Polaric APRSD

The "*Polaric Server*" is mainly a web-based service to present APRS-tracking information on maps and where 
the information is updated in real-time. It was originally targeted for use by radio amateurs in voluntary 
search and rescue service in Norway. It consists of a web-application and a server program (APRS daemon). The project has a focus on the ability to run as a "offline" service, on interoperability and security.
 
The APRS daemon (aprsd) gets data from a TNC or APRS-IS or a combination. Users can present 
and manipulate the information through a HTTP service (REST API) and updates is streamed through a Websocket. 
The daemon can also be set up as an igate (internet gateway) or a edge APRS-IS server. It can be installed and run independently of the web app. It provides its own webserver based on the *polaric-core* framework. 

*Polaric-aprsd* is meant to be used as a backend-server for *polaric-webapp2*.

http://aprs.no runs a recent version of this software. More documentation on the project can be found here: 
http://aprs.no/polaricserver.

## Installation

We provide deb (Debian/Ubuntu..) packages. For information on getting started on a Debian based platform please 
see: https://polaricserver.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gettingstarted.html

From version 4.0, Polaric-APRSD uses *systemd* for service management. See [docs/systemd-migration.md](docs/systemd-migration.md) for migration details and usage instructions.

Documentation on the project can be found here: 
http://aprs.no/polaricserver

To configure a server, use the client app: *webapp2*. Some command-line scripts are also available: 
*polaric-setcall*, *polaric-password*, etc.   

For first-time login use account: username=admin, password=polaric. Remember to change the password at your fist
convenience. 

## Building from source 

You can always compile the sources to a jar file using the 'build.sh' script, on a Linux system a deb package can be generated by using:
   *'debuild -uc -us -b'* 
   
You will need JDK (OpenJDK) version 17 or later. Maven is used for the build process.

From version 4.0 we use *Javalin* for the webserver-part and a webserver-framework is factored out in a separate software-component: [polaric-core](https://github.com/PolaricServer/Polaric-Core). This is built separately but is just a *'mvn install'*. The polaric-core is also available from Maven Central.
