==================
APRS-IS Filters
==================

Overview
========

Polaric APRSD implements APRS-IS server-side filters to control which packets are delivered to its clients. They are also used internally. These filters implement the standard APRS-IS filter specification, and adds some Polaric APRSD specific extensions. These are: *All-packets*, *channel-filter (C)* and *conjunction* (&).  

Filter Syntax
=============

Basic Syntax
------------

Filters consist of filter commands separated by spaces. Each filter command has the format::

    <command>[/<parameter1>[/<parameter2>...]]

Logical Operators
-----------------

Disjunction (OR)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Filters separated by spaces represent a logical OR. The packet passes if ANY filter matches::

    a/59.0/10.0/60.0/11.0 b/LA*

This matches packets in the area OR packets with callsigns starting with "LA".

Conjunction (AND)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Prepend ``&`` to create a conjunction with the immediately preceding filter::

    a/59.0/10.0/60.0/11.0 &t/p

This matches packets that are BOTH in the area AND are position reports.

Multiple conjunctions can be chained::

    a/59.0/10.0/60.0/11.0 &t/p &b/LA*

This matches packets in the area AND are position reports AND have callsigns starting with "LA".

You can combine OR and AND operations::

    a/59.0/10.0/60.0/11.0 &t/p b/LA*

This matches: (packets in area AND position reports) OR (callsigns starting with "LA").

Exception (NOT)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Prepend ``-`` to create an exception filter. If an exception filter matches, the entire result is false, regardless of other filters::

    t/p -b/NOCALL*

This matches position reports EXCEPT those from callsigns starting with "NOCALL".

Exceptions can be combined with conjunctions::

    -t/x &p/LA

This means NOT(type x AND prefix LA).

Complex Filter Examples
=======================

Position Reports in Area
------------------------

Get all position reports in a specific area::

    a/59.0/10.0/60.0/11.0 &t/p

Position Reports Except One Station
------------------------------------

Get position reports except from a specific station::

    t/p -b/NOCALL

Objects Within Range of Station
--------------------------------

Get objects within 50 km of a station::

    t/o/LA1B/50

Weather Reports in Area
-----------------------

Get weather reports in a specific area::

    a/59.0/10.0/60.0/11.0 &t/w

All Traffic for Specific Stations
----------------------------------

Get all packets from specific callsigns::

    b/LA1B*/OH2*

Position and Object Reports with Prefix
----------------------------------------

Get positions and objects from stations with specific prefixes::

    t/po &p/LA

Messages and Objects, Excluding Test Callsigns
-----------------------------------------------

Get messages and objects, but exclude test stations::

    t/mo -b/TEST*

Implementation Notes
====================

Case Sensitivity
----------------

* Callsign patterns are converted to uppercase for matching
* Pattern matching is case-insensitive

Wildcard Conversion
-------------------

Wildcards in patterns are converted to regular expressions:

* ``*`` becomes ``(.*)`` (matches any sequence)
* ``?`` becomes ``.`` (matches any single character)

Filter Evaluation Order
-----------------------

1. Exception filters (``-``) are evaluated first
2. If any exception filter matches, the result is FALSE
3. Positive filters are evaluated next
4. If any positive filter matches, the result is TRUE
5. If no filters match, the result is FALSE

Performance Considerations
--------------------------

* Range filters require position lookup, which may impact performance
* Wildcard patterns are pre-compiled to regular expressions for efficiency
* Area filters use simple coordinate comparison
