Default: NOCALL
Description: What is your callsign?
 When connecting to APRS-IS (or when sending out information), you need to identify yourself
 with a unique identifier. This should normally be your amateur radio callsign (possibly 
 with a ssid).
 .
 This is the minimum needed information to get the daemon up running. It will connect to
 aprs.no (IS server) using this identifier and start receiving data. Please edit
 /etc/polaric-aprsd/server.ini to suit your needs.
